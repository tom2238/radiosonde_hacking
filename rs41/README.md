# RS41 project
* Some C projects for Vaisala RS41 radiosonde with stm32f100c8 MCU
* Using `QtCreator` as IDE and `Makefile` file for compilling, 
* Developen with 'LibOpenCM3' firmware library http://libopencm3.org/
* For erase and write code is `st-flash` used https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink

## Projects
* blink - Blinking with two onboard leds using stupid delay loop
* fancyblink - Blinking with two onboard leds using timer and millis counter
* si4032_cw - ISM band CW transmitter using Si4032 onboard chip
* si4032_fifo - ISM band transmitter using Si4032 onboard chip, use FIFO mode and GFSK modulation, short packet transmission
* adc_uart - Measure MCU voltage and send it over UART
* si4032_long_packet - ISM band transmitter using Si4032 onboard chip, use FIFO mode and GFSK modulation, long packet transmission
* si4032_infinite_packet - ISM band transmitter using Si4032 onboard chip, use FIFO mode and GFSK modulation, packet length over 255 bytes, tx packet handler is off
* si4032_infinite_manchester - ISM band transmitter using Si4032 onboard chip, use FIFO mode and GFSK modulation, continuous packet transmission with Manchester coding, , tx packet handler is off
* si4032_aprs - APRS tracker, use FIFO mode and GFSK modulation
